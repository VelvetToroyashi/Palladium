This repository serves as the central place for a collection of single-purpose Discord bots developed by myself (Velvet).
These bots generally work on the principle of User-Apps, allowing them to be used anywhere.

## Bookmarker
Exactly what it sounds like - bookmark anything, anywhere.

As of ~August or perhaps September of 2024, Discord decided to stop dragging their feet and release the feature that staff had had for years to the public (kind of), and "add" a bookmark feature to the client natively. This being said, this feature is not only liked to nitro subs (lmao), but only about 10% of users can access the feature as of December 2024.
